This project of mine should provide a pricing mechanism for financial
derivatives.
Parts of it are inspired by Joshi's "The Concepts and Practice of
Mathematical Finance" and "C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives
Pricing".

I provide two pricing mechanisms. One via the analytical formulas and
a Monte-Carlo pricing scheme which is used for validation.
