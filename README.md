This project of mine should provide a pricing mechanism for financial
derivatives. It corresponds to project 1 in Joshi's "The
Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance".

I provide two pricing mechanisms. One via the analytical formulas and
a Monte-Carlo pricing scheme which is used for validation.
